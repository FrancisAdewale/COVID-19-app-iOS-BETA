#
# if you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19),
# however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. (The
# ending isolation section below has more information)â€¨after 7 days, if you do
# not have a high temperature, you do not need to continue to self-isolate. If
# you still have a high temperature, keep self-isolating until your temperature
# returns to normal. You do not need to self-isolate if you just have a cough
# after 7 days, as a cough can last for several weeks after the infection has
# gone
